# Overview


This project is a text-based Expense Tracker application written in Java. It allows users to input, view, and manage basic personal expenses, demonstrating foundational Java skills such as object-oriented programming, file input/output, and use of collections.

My goal in writing this software was to gain hands-on experience with Java syntax and structure while learning how to build and organize a multi-class application. This project helped me become more comfortable with using the Java Collections Framework, working with file persistence, and applying key programming concepts like loops, conditionals, and encapsulation.
